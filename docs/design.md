# Components

The overall style of the website will be minimalistic 'BookShell' layout that layers grid-lined paper textures beneath glassy elements.

CSS variables can be used to keep spreads consistent through typography, spacing and depth.

As a general design principle, depth will be achieved through shades and bordering, but depth is not as important as simple z-axis rendering of components.

shadcn components will be themed through a shared `ThemeProvider` so that accents, shadows and button shapes stay consistent and planner-true. The accent color for this application will be `Lime`, preliminarily.

The UI will be responsive first, with desktop formatting being the initial priority, with focus on a two-page spread that mimics a planner.

## shadcn

- **Library**: Radix UI
