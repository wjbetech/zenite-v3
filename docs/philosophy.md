## Philosophy

zenite-v3 is the third iteration of my prodoctivity website. This iteration is a deliberate attempt to bring the high-quality, leather planner into the digital world as faithfully as possible.

That means tactile design where users can feel deeply intentional about all of their interactions.

The application should be comfortable, yet nostalgic in design, and should inspire the user to genuinely spend time, energy and thought in the same way that they would do with a brand new planner that they have bought in person.

The modern web affords all of this with the added benefit of editing, font management, scaling, adaptive layouts, micro-animations, and more. The application should feel like writing on paper, without all of the negatives of hand writing tasks on paper.

The application is initialized with Next.js 16.1.1 on 9th January 2026, meaning we are using the App router method. TS is prioritised for contracts, and Tailwind /w shadcn will handle styles for composable, foundational, and accessible UI primitives.
